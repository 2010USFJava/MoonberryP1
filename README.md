## Features

List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* Employees or approvers can log in and log out. The session data is saved in cookies.
* Employees can submit forms to mke new reimbursement requests. Validation is performed before the form can be submitted. If the reimbursement is submitted within 2 weeks of the event's start date, the request is marked urgent.
* Approvers can approve or reject the reimbursement requests.

To-do list:
* Provide functionality for the user to request more reimbursement than their yearly $1000 allocation.
* Automatically archive old completed requests so the "pending" requests are more visible.
